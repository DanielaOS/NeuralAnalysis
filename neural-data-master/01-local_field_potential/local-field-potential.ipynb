    "The Local [Field Potential (LFP)](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Local_field_potential#:~:text=The%20local%20field%20potential%20) is the name that neuroscientists use to refer to the extracellular electric potential, i.e. the potential in the space around neurons.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of LFP signals to investigate neural activity is common in systems neuroscience, due to the relative ease of recording (a single electrode is sufficient to extract the signal) and the rich variety of oscillatory phenomena it allows to probe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LFP results from the activity of the local neural population (in contrast with electrocorticography and electroencefalography, whose signal is the result of the activity of large cortical areas), but it is not directly related to spiking activity: the main contribution to LFP comes from the postsynaptic membrane potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will look at a series of preprocessing and analysis methods used in the analysis of LFP. They all rely on the fact that the LFP is a continuous signal (unlike spiking activity) usually sampled with very high time resolution (unlike calcium signals). This makes it tractable with a large family of signal processing tools.\n",

    "## Fourier analysis and power spectrum\n",
    "---\n",
    "Continuous signals can often be decomposed as a superposition of elementary building blocks. For a signal that is sampled for a long time, a useful description is obtained by decomposing it as a sum of sine and cosine waves with different frequencies.\n",
    "For a periodic signal of period $T$, this is called Fourier decomposition and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} c_{n} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{T}nt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex exponentials are oscillator with different frequencies, and the fourier coefficients $c_{n}$ represents the weight of each oscillator in the decomposition of the signal.\n",
    "The weights $c_{n}$ are computed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_{n}=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{T}x(t)e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{T}nt} dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula can be roughly interpreted as the covariance of the signal $x(t)$ (when its average over $T$ is zero) with the oscillatory pattern $e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{T}nt}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourier decomposition can be mathematically extended to non-periodic signals by sending the period $T$ to infinity. This is known as the Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the square modulus of the coefficients $c_{n}$, we obtain the power spectrum of the signal, that we can use to gauge the contributions of different frequencies."

    "[Sharp Wave Ripples (SWRs)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-018-0077-1) are a prominent oscillation pattern found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, during sleep or awake rests. They have been hypothesized to play an important role in the cortical consolidation of memories formed into the hippocampus (see this paper for a review: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-018-0077-1).\n",
