    "The LFP results from the activity of the **local** neural population, in contrast with electrocorticography and electroencefalography, whose signal is the result of the activity of large cortical area, but it is not directly related to spiking activity: **the main contribution to LFP comes from the postsynaptic membrane potentials**.\n",

They all rely on the fact that **LFP is continuous signal** (unlike spiking activity) usually **sampled with very high time resolution**.
